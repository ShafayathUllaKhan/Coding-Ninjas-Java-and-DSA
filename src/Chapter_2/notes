Absolutely! Let’s explain 8 and -8 in 4-bit binary using two’s complement, step by step.

⚠️ IMPORTANT:
❗ 4-bit numbers can only represent values from:
css
Copy code
-8 to +7
Why?

MSB = 0 → Positive numbers: 0000 (0) to 0111 (+7)

MSB = 1 → Negative numbers: 1000 (-8) to 1111 (-1)

So, +8 cannot be represented in 4 bits. It overflows.

✅ Now Let's See:
-8 in 4-bit binary (Two’s Complement)
This is directly represented as:

yaml
Copy code
1000
👉 In 4-bit two’s complement, 1000 is -8.

What About +8?
ini
Copy code
1000 = -8  ❌ Not +8
So +8 is NOT representable in 4 bits because the range only goes up to +7.

Trying to store +8 in 4 bits will cause overflow.

🔁 Valid 4-bit Two’s Complement Range:
Decimal	4-bit Binary
-8	1000
-7	1001
-6	1010
-5	1011
-4	1100
-3	1101
-2	1110
-1	1111
0	0000
1	0001
2	0010
3	0011
4	0100
5	0101
6	0110
7	0111

❌ 8 cannot be stored in 4-bit two’s complement.

🧠 Why is -8 represented as 1000?
It's the lowest number that can be stored in 4 bits.

Two’s complement makes it work perfectly in arithmetic.

✅ Summary
✔ -8 in 4-bit binary: 1000

❌ +8 can’t be represented in 4-bit binary

4-bit two’s complement covers -8 to +7
